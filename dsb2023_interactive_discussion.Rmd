1. A quick walk through the RStudio IDE running on our servers. Highlight that it is basically the same user experience you get on your laptop. I'll crunch some data, produce some visualizations, and create a model. 

2. Highlight the ResearchDrive integration. Seamless access from the IDE to 4T of storage. 

3. Post the data to a pinboard

4. Publish a API with the model

6. Launch q VS Code session and access the models through and API

7. Future features
